I'm Hans. I'm currently a Magento developer.

I am an ambition person, who loves learning new things and always keep me up to date with the new technologies. I'm trying to be a full stack web developer.

In the free time, I like reading books, playing guitar and listening to music. I love travel also. I hope I can travel to Japan one day.
