<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
<p>This is my programming blog, where you can find the articles on web programming. I'm currently working as a web developer at <a href="http://www.dtn.com.vn/" target="_blank">DTN Software Solutions</a>.</p>

<p>My daily work is building websites using Magento. I have been working with Magento 1 for 5 years and also had 3 months experience working with Magento 2 until now. I have passed the <a href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/certification/directory/dev/2320665/" target="_blank">Magento Developer Plus Certification</a>. My work involves creating or updating ecommerce websites, creating Magento extensions. And although they are often backend tasks but I'm very interested in learning the frontend technologies like CSS3, HTML5 and Javascript. I'm trying to be a fullstack developer.</p>
<p>I'm Vietnamese, so you can find that my English is not very good :).</p>
